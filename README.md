HoHLabs: 
========

Built a kernel from scratch with menu based interactive shell, incorporating coroutines as well as fibers, along with implementing non-preemptive and preemptive scheduling, and SPSC queue for core-core communications. 

The kernel was built on top of the [https://hohlabs.github.io/](HoHlabs) framework designed to create a kernel from scratch. The Entire work is divided into three main sections, which are subsequently built on the top of the previous one, and can be found in different branches of this repository.
